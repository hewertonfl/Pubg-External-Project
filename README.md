# Data Science Dashboard: Stock Price vs Revenue Comparison

## Introduction
Welcome to the Data Science Dashboard project! In this assignment, we will be extracting revenue data for two companies, Tesla and GameStop, and building a dashboard to compare their stock prices with their respective revenues. This project is designed for data scientists working for an investment firm and aims to provide valuable insights into the relationship between stock prices and company revenues.

Before proceeding with this assignment, please make sure you have completed the two previous labs on **yfinance** and **web scraping**. This will ensure that you have the necessary knowledge and skills to successfully complete this project.

## Project Overview
The main objective of this assignment is to extract revenue data for Tesla and GameStop, gather their stock price information, and create a dashboard that visually compares the stock prices of these companies with their corresponding revenues. This will allow us to analyze any potential relationships between stock prices and revenue trends.

To accomplish this, we will follow these steps:

1. Extract revenue data for Tesla and GameStop:
    - Use web scraping techniques to extract revenue information from reliable sources.
    - Store the extracted revenue data in a structured format for further analysis.

2. Gather stock price data for Tesla and GameStop:
    - Use the **yfinance** library to retrieve historical stock price data for the desired timeframe.
    - Store the stock price data in a suitable format for visualization.

3. Build the dashboard:
    - Use data visualization library, such as **Matplotlib** or **Plotly**, to create meaningful visualizations of the stock prices and revenues.
    - Compare the trends of stock prices and revenues over time using appropriate visualizations, such as line charts or area plots.
    - Enhance the dashboard with labels, titles, and legends to improve readability and understanding.
